* sensi.py: it is the main script to estimate the CTA sensitivity with cssens. Please note that I use the “integral” sensitivity (for details see the first link in the Section “Useful links” below). For the help you can run the following command:

	> python sensi.py --help

* grb.xml: it is an example of the xml file that should be given in input. It is basically the source model; the spectral parameters in this file should be modified accordingly to the GRB characteristics (for details on the supported spectral models, see the second link in the Section “Useful links” below).
Another general example of such a file is “crab.xml”, that can be found in $CTOOLS/share/models ($CTOOLS is the installation directory of ctools)

* sensi-5sigma_obstime-610s_irf-North_z20_0.5h.txt: it is an example of output of sensi.py

* runShJobs.py: it is a baseline script to automatically run multiple times sensi.py assuming different observing times; this script should be adapted depending on the way you submit jobs. Please not that other input parameters can be easily added if needed (accordingly to sensi.py)  

* ReadSensi.py: it reads the files produced with sensi.py and creates a unique file with the CTA sensitivities as a function of the observing times; in this final file there are 5 columns: 1. Observing time 2. Flux in Crab units 3. Photon flux 4. Energy flux 5. Sensitivity. Please note that the names of the Input and Output files should be changed depending on which simulations you are using (IRF and CTA site).
